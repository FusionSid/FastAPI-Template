# FastAPI-Template

I've been creating a lot of fastapi api's recently and noticed that they all follow a similar structure. Usually when creating a new one i just go to the previous one and copy files to my new rest api. So i'm creating this template so it will be easier to make quick fastapi in the future.

The structure of this repository is catered for my usecase and how I like it so the main target user for the template is just myself. But if you do like it or have suggestions you can use it too or make a pull with suggestions.
